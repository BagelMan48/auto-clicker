# auto-clicker
Second project! As a child, I remembered seeing my friends getting 10+ clicks per second while I was at a mere 7. At the time, it sounded so superhuman to me that I assumed they were cheating.
While I may never know if they were cheating or not, now I have my very own "helper" (that I made myself!) to rival them.</br>
For those who may have lived through that story, or for those living through it right now, you can rewrite your history. With this program, you will have power. No one can oppress you any longer unless they too possess the same technology that I have given you. </br>
First time using threading and pynput and I have to say, they were pretty cool to use. Intimidated me at first and took me many attempts to properly implement, but we got there in the end! </br>

## Features
- Customizable keybind for autoclick toggle
- Customizable click speed (and it shows the interval between each click up to 3 decimal places)
- Click counter at the end of the program

## Example procedure
Entering the key you want to turn on/off your autoclicker</br>
![Entering the letter R for my key](https://i.imgur.com/u2rQI7e.png) </br>

Entering the amount of clicks per second and it shows me how frequent the program will be clicking</br>
![Entering 13 for clicks per second and it shows 0.077 as interval between each click](https://i.imgur.com/80rajNO.png)</br>
 
Entered "n" to make sure that my auto clicker doesn't start clicking at an inconvenient time</br>

Had fun toggling the autoclicker but unfortunately, I had to stop the fun and press esc. At least I get to see how many times my autoclicker clicked before shutting down</br>

That's it. It was kinda a toughie but I managed to do it! I don't think there is anything more to add, but if there is then I will see if I can implement it :D
